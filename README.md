# Fraud_ANN
Research into using ANN (Autoencoder + MLP) por fraud detection

n this small project o tried to build a predictive models usignf a two stage model:

  - build a autoecoder that encapsulates the information about the majority transations (not fraud)
  - Using the autoencoder as first layer for a MLP to predict fraud.
  
 As at now i only used ROse resample for bildina more balanced trains data set. I will add mote later
